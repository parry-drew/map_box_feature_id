# Map Box Feature ID

The [Create a hover effect](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/hover-styles/) example from Mapbpox GL requires an id number for each feature that is outside "properties" array. This script will add this id to a GeoJSON.

1. In the command line change directory to the location of the MapBoxFeatureID.py.

```
    cd Your\MapBoxFeatureID.py
```

2. Run the script as seen below. The example below is a very basic. The first half is call the python.exe location. The second half is the Python script.

```
    C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.X\python.exe MapBoxFeatureID.py
```

3. When prompted drag the geojson in to the command line or type out the entire directory of that geojson.
